Factoids Web App
================
A simple web app for use with the [Factoids](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/factoids/) Bukkit plugin ([source](https://github.com/Qowface/Factoids)).

Features
--------
* All of your facts are displayed in order by ID.
* Typing in the search box filters out all of the facts that don't match.
* Search by everything, or just by the ID/title.
* Links are parsed and color codes are stripped out automatically.

This is inspired by and based off of the [searchable FAQ list](http://guru.syfaro.net/faq.php) used by #minecrafthelp.
